		<h1>About the Port of Rotterdam</h1>
		<p>
			The Port of Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe. To maintain this
			position and to facilitate continued growth, the IT systems the port’s
			stakeholders use to exchange data need to be smarter. The Rotterdam
			Logistics Lab plays a major role in this effort, by devising and trying
			out smart solutions to accelerate this transformation. The projects on
			this front are aimed at improving efficiency and safety by combining and
			enriching the event-data of Port of Rotterdam stakeholders in a smart
			fashion. These enrichments are near real-time and predictive.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Rotterdam Logistics Lab is the Port of Rotterdam’s innovation lab. Via
			the lab, the Port quickly develops new potential products for its
			stakeholders using the latest technologies. Codestar helps the Port of
			Rotterdam by quickly developing these initiatives into real-life products.
			Our agile and effective working method is a perfect match for the MVP
			dynamics of the innovation lab. And our extensive knowledge of near
			real-time reactive technologies and this predictive stream-based
			processing are perfectly suited to meet the technical challenges of these
			projects.
