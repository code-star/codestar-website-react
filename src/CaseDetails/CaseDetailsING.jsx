		<h1>About ING</h1>
		<p>
			ING: the bank as an IT company with a banking license. ING wants to be the
			world leading innovator on financial technology and offers an atmosphere
			that is attractive to developers. More than 300 developers work on varying
			aspects of ING's online presence. To support this ING has embraced the
			Spotify agile model and DevOps, making each team responsible for the
			business and IT side of one or more applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			Codestar is working on INGâ€™s online appointment scheduling service: the
			first straight-through appointment service for a bank in The Netherlands.
			Customers, prospects and employees can schedule an appointment online with
			a financial advisor with the right skills to handle their specific need
			(mortgage, financial advice).
		</p>
		<p>
			The system substantially improves the conversion rate and thereby the
			sales funnel. This is a key IT project within assisted channels (financial
			advisory at ING offices) which will form the technical backbone in future
			contact between ING and its clients or prospects.
		</p>
		<h1>About the system</h1>
		<p>
			The system integrates with the Exchange calendars of 1300 advisors,
			meeting rooms in 250 branch offices, and other appointment scheduling
			systems in the bank to do near real-time checks for availability to
			optimize the customer experience. The backend uses Scala, Cassandra and
			asynchronous programming techniques to create a scalable platform so its
			use can be expanded to other countries.
		</p>
		<p>
			ING firmly believes in the promise of standardized component driven
			development and a universal design language for front-end development. ING
			has adopted web components (Polymer) and Material Design to make the ING
			front-end stack ready for years to come. The appointment scheduling
			service is part of the world-wide ING transition from AngularJS to
			Polymer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Codestar supplies the full-stack expertise and a broad knowledge of
			platforms to support the maintenance of the appointment scheduling system
			and the migration to the new platform.
