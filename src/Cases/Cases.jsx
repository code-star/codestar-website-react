					'We made the code simple, readable and testable by developing a DSL in Scala. Not just for programmers, but for the business too. And we did all that with a fraction of the amount of code needed for the old implementation in Java. Eventually, not only was the business able to read the code, they were also able to implement calculations themselves. The business that speaks the language of the programmer. Goal achieved.',

The client needs a new payment platform that supports apps and modern devices, enables them to go live quickly with new features and is easier to manage. The current outdated platform was completely custom developed in-house for SKG, including hosting and physical servers. We are building a new reactive platform that scales, is easy to maintain, uses the latest technologies and methodologies, such as Microservices, Platform as a Service and Continuous Delivery.',

Using a fully cloud-based development route made it possible to demonstrate functionality in the product environment from week one, and give shape to the short feedback loops. So no meetings about abstract software diagrams, but about working software. Agile, as agile is meant to be.',
